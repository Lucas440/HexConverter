### This is a List of Assumptions I made while making this
1. The boolean feilds relate to the size of the bits to this is checked if the first Character was a letter or greater than 9
2. The feild TextA does not give a output that is readable and is just a random assorment of characters
3. ShortA only refers to the first bit and the total value for this Hex
